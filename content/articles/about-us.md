# About Us

Who am I?

I am the one who knocks... no just kidding :)

I'm **Type-32**, the founder of **CTRL Neo Studios**. We were originally CRTL Prototype Studios (yes, that's not a typo), to which we rebranded at the end of 2024. The studio started in late 2022, as a small club project that has now evolved into a somewhat small and manageable studio.

Our studio right now consists of 3 core members: me (@Type-32), Alpinecore (@ALpinecore), DeadAxe121 (@ansonzhang2009); me being the founder and backbone of all of the tech stacks we've used in studio projects, ALpinecore being the upcoming full-stack developer & DevOps engineer, and DeadAxe121 being an outstanding Chemistry scholar and upcoming Machine-Learning + Web Developer.

We have numerous projects, but the ones that stands out the most are:

1. WYSIWYG CodeMirror 6 based Obsidian-like Markdown Editor Component: <https://github.com/Type-32/codemirror-rich-obsidian>
2. SQLite ORM-like Wrapper for Tauri v2's SQLite Database Plugin: <https://github.com/Type-32/tauri-sqlite-orm>
